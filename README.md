# SemSegBuildings_Flask
For this project I will be using the [fast.ai framework](https://docs.fast.ai/) and the [Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset](https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/) to train a semantic segmentation model. The goal is to use this model to run inferences on new imagery and to expose these inferences on an [interactive map](https://alpha.anthropo.co/znz-demo) inspired by [daveluo](https://github.com/daveluo/zanzibar-aerial-mapping).

Much of this repo is base skeleton for the flask application side that will be incorporated later but the current progress on the model can be found in the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dataondeck/TakeHomes/blob/master/SemSegBuildings_Flask/SegSemBuildings.ipynb)
