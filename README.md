SemSegBuildings

![Suburb](SemSegBuildings/Suburb.jpg?raw=true "Imagery")

For this project I will be using the [fast.ai framework](https://docs.fast.ai/) and the [Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset](https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/) to train a semantic segmentation model. The goal is to use this model to run inferences on new imagery and to expose these inferences on an [interactive map](https://alpha.anthropo.co/znz-demo) inspired by [daveluo](https://github.com/daveluo/zanzibar-aerial-mapping).

Current progress on the model can be found in the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/SharpestProjects/SemSegBuildings/blob/master/SemSegBuildings/SemSegBuildings.ipynb)
